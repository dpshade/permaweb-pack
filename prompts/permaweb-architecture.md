I'm a {{background}} wanting to build {{goal}} on the permaweb. 

Explain the permaweb architecture in practical terms:

1. **Core difference** from traditional web hosting
2. **Why Arweave** provides permanent storage guarantees  
3. **AO vs SmartWeave** - when to use each
4. **Development stack** - what tools I need
5. **Cost model** - how pricing works
6. **Getting started** - first steps for my background

Focus on practical implications for building {{goal}} and avoid marketing fluff.
